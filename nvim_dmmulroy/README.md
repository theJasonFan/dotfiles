## Backlog notes from Feb 2024

**These are now outdated as of March 2025...**

_last updated: Feb 2024_

Configs for basic tools.

- Neovim and Tmux configs based on [Dillon](https://github.com/dmmulroy/kickstart.nix)
  [Mulroy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo_I5lAmdi0)'s configs. I've removed LSPs plugins I don't need
  and also removed CoPilot.

### Todos

- [ ] gruvbox colors as an option
- [ ] update whichkey for better discoverability
- [ ] fix window splitting to suit personal preference, I don't use `/` or `ENTER` to split panes
- [ ] Add support for Rust and Python linters / autoformat
- [ ] Check auto strip whitespace
- [ ] Check tabs for Python / rust
- [ ] Add groovy + nextflow, and snakemake
- [ ] Add bioSyntax support for easier .sam, fastq, fasta viewing?

### Issues

- wilder and search finds line numbers in oil buffer
- some icons are broken, Ideally I replace icons with unicode chars
